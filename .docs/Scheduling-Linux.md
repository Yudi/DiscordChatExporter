# Scheduling exports with Cron

## What is Cron?

Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and macOS. It allows users to schedule jobs (commands or scripts) to run at specific intervals or times.

## Creating the script

1. Open Terminal

2. Set the script's path to a variable with `SCRIPT_PATH="/path/to/DiscordChatExporter.Cli/cron-script.sh"` so you don't have to type it repeatedly

3. Create a new text file with `nano "$SCRIPT_PATH"`

> [!TIP]
> You can't use your mouse in nano, use the arrow keys to control the cursor (caret).

3. Copy the code below and paste it into the text file. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# DiscordChatExporter - Cron Script
# Project Info: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter

# -e - exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
# -u - treat unset variables as an error when substituting
# -o pipefail - return the exit status of the last command in the pipeline that failed
set -euo pipefail

4. On the configuration section, replace insert the values between the quotes:

- `TOKEN`: Insert the [Token](Token-and-IDs.md).
- `CHANNEL_ID`: Insert a [Channel ID](Token-and-IDs.md).
- `DCE_FOLDER`: DCE's **folder** path (e.g. `"/path/to/DCE.Cli"`, not `"/path/to/DCE.Cli/DiscordChatExporter.dll"`).
- `EXPORT_FOLDER`: Directory the exported chats will be saved to (e.g. `"/home/user/Documents/Discord Exports"`).
- `FILENAME`: Exported channel's filename.
- `EXPORT_FORMAT`: Export format. Options: `PlainText`, `HtmlDark`, `HtmlLight`, `Json`, `Csv`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure not to delete the quotes (") when replacing: `DCE_FOLDER="/home/my user/DCE"`.
> Don't use quotes as part of the paths: `"/home/my user/"Carpe Diem" server"`.

> [!TIP]
> To save, hold down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and then press <kbd>O</kbd>. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> to exit the text editor.  
> [Check out the Gentoo Nano Guide](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nano/Guide) if you want to know more about `nano`.

5. Make your script executable with `chmod +x "$SCRIPT_PATH"`

6. To run the script with user privileges, edit the cron file with `crontab -e` (preferred).  
   To run the script as root, edit it with `sudo crontab -e`.  
   If you're running this command for the first time, you might be asked to select a text editor: Press <kbd>1</kbd> and then <kbd>‚èé Enter</kbd> to confirm `nano` as your text editor.

7. Add the following to the end of the file:

```
* * * * * "/path/to/DiscordChatExporter.Cli/cron-script.sh" >/tmp/discordchatexporter.log 2>/tmp/discordchatexportererror.log
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Replace `"/path/to/DiscordChatExporter.Cli/cron-script.sh"` with the path to your script.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't want logs to be saved, replace both `/tmp/discordchatexporter[error].log` with `/dev/null`.

Then replace the asterisks (`*`) with the desired schedule as follows:

**Examples:**

- If you want to execute the script at minute 15 of every hour: `15 * * * *`
- Every 30 minutes: `*/30 * * * *`
- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`
- Every day at noon: `0 12 * * *`
- Every day at 3, 4 and 6 PM: `0 15,16,18 * * *`
- Every Wednesday at 9 AM: `0 9 * * 3`

## Additional information

### Cron

The week starts on Sunday. 0 = SUN, 1 = MON ... 7 = SUN.

Use military time (24-hour format) for hours.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you set the day to '31', the script will only run on months that have the 31st day.  
> [Learn more about running a cron job on the last day of the month here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6139189/cron-job-to-run-on-the-last-day-of-the-month) (expert).

### Script

The default filename for the exported channel is `YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss-yourfilename.ext`. You can change it if you'd like.

You can test the script anytime by running it with `./cron-script.sh`.

Don't forget to update your token in the script if it has been reset!
