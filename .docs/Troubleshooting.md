## DCE outputs an error and the exported file is incomplete

Make sure you're using the latest version of DCE and try exporting again.

If you're using the latest version, [check if your issue has already been reported](<(https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/issues?q=is%3Aissue)>).
In case it hasn't, [open a bug report](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/issues/new).

Providing an invitation link to the channel you are attempting to export from can significantly speed up the resolution of the issue.  
If sharing an invitation link is not possible, include a detailed and comprehensive description of the problem to assist in troubleshooting and reproducing the issue.
