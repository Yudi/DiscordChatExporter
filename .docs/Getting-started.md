### HTML

The HTML format replicates Discord's interface, making it the most user-friendly option.  
It's the best format for viewing media, such as images and videos, and for sharing with others.

You can open `.html` files with a web browser, such as Google Chrome.

> [!WARNING]
> If a picture is deleted, or if a user changes its avatar, the respective images will no longer be displayed.  
> Export using the "Download assets" (`--media`) option to avoid this.

### Plain Text

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PbUyRXD.png" height="400"/>

The Plain Text format is a simple text file that contains the messages in a readable format. It has the smallest size of all formats.
You can open `.txt` files with a text editor, such as Notepad.

### JSON

The JSON format contains more technical information about the messages and is easily parsable.  
You can open `.json` files with a text editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

### CSV (deprecated)

> Use the JSON format instead.
